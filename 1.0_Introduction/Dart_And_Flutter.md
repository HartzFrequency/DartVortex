## Dart with Flutter 
The Flutter team evaluated more than a dozen languages and picked Dart because it matched the way they were building user interfaces.

### Optimised UI
1. Asynchronous operations: common asynchronous operations:
    * Fetching data over a network
    * Writing to a database
    * Reading data from a file

2. Dart code runs inside of isolates. Each isolate has its own memory heap, ensuring that no isolateâ€™s state is accessible from any other isolate.

3. optimized for building user interfaces

### Productive Development 
1. Flutter has a hot reload feature that helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs

2. Flutter provides static analysis which allows you to find problems before executing a single line of code

### Fast on all platforms 
1. Dart has an AOT (Ahead of Time) compiler, which compiles to fast, predictable, native code that allows almost all of Flutter to be written in Dart.
