# The num Type
If we want a variable that has a number value, we will declare it using the num data type.

Dart numbers are further divided into two subtypes:
- Integers (int) : Integers are whole numbers without a decimal point.
- Doubles (double) : Doubles are numbers that include a decimal point.

Integer literals are automatically converted to doubles when necessary. When you run the code snippet below, the output displayed will be 1.0 rather than 1.
