# Strings
## What are strings?
A Dart string is a sequence of UTF-16 code units. UTF stands for Unicode Transformation Format. Unicode is a set of characters in which each character is a unique code unit.

## Strings Literals
string literals are simply text encapsulated in quotation marks.
```
"This is how strings are written"
```

Note: we can use an escape character ( \ ) which tells the compiler to escape the built-in functionality of the single quotation and evaluate it as a string.
