# Data Type 
The data type of an item or variable is an attribute that tells us what kind of operations can be performed on data.

## Dart’s built-in data type
The Dart language has special support for the following types:

- Numbers
- Strings
- Booleans
- Lists
- Sets
- Maps
- Runes
- Symbols

## Values and Refrences
Data types can be broadly divided into two categories:

- Reference type
- Value type

The information provided by a value type is the value itself. For a reference type, the information it provides is a reference to some object, i.e., the memory address of where an object is stored

## Data type and Object
In most languages, primitive data types are value types, but in Dart, all data types are objects. This means that even primitive data types are reference types. Therefore, we can say that in Dart, variables specifically store references and are referring to objects.

## Default Value
Uninitialized variables have an initial value of ***NULL***.<br/>
 Even variables with numeric types are initially null because numbers are objects. null simply means that the variable is not referencing an object; it’s not referencing anything.
