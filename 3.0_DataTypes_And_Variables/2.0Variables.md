# Variables 
Variables are used for storing information which can then be used by the computer program.

### Declaring a variable in Dart
```
dataType variableName = Initial Value
```

### Dart Styling Convention 
It is a Dart styling convention to name variables using lower camel case. In other words, you should capitalize the first letter of each word except the first word, and use no separators, eg., lowerCamelCase.

### Printing Variable 
```
print(variableName)
```
